<h2 class="text-center">Who am I?</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  My name is Angel Perez, Information engineer, backend developer, polyglot (ES/EN/FR),
  self-trained, <em>not-so-amateur</em> photographer, nerd about all things music, and
  Venezuelan expat living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="City in Spain">València</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="text-center">What I do</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  I've been crafting <em>state-of-the-art</em> Ruby applications in remote
  fashion since 2017 throughout multiple industries and open-source projects.
  From 2020 to 2022, I've had the opportunity to lead a small, distributed
  engineering team across the Americas.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  Besides software engineering, I'm also deeply interested in art, history,
  languages, literature, music (I consider myself a <em>music-driven</em> human being),
  psychology, and philosophy.
</p>

<h2 class="text-center">Interested?</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  I'm currently <b>available for hire</b>! Feel free to reach out through any of the
  links below if you believe we could work together :)
